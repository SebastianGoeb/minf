# HOW TO CREATE FLOW RULES
==========================

./generateScripts.py <topology file>

The script creates two types of rules; i) forwarding rules and ii) CherryPick
rules (the rules to tag switches IDs in order to trace packet trajectory).

An example topology file is given in config/topology.yaml. Note that the
topology describes the testbed setup used by the PathDump team at the
University of Edinburgh.

===========================
# HOW TO INSTALL FLOW RULES
===========================

./install_rules.sh

Note that this script is also tailored for the testbed setup at the University
of Edinburgh. The testbed comprises of Pica8 switches, which support SSH. This
script installs the generated flow rules via SSH. Hence, it is quite handy to
set up an SSH key at those switches.
